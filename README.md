# Nitori Computers

Nitori Computers is a fictional online computer store. The frontend was made with React/Typescript and Next JS, while the backend uses Express JS and Mongoose. The articles' data is stored on a database (MongoDB). 

The website allows the user to search and browse through the articles, sort them, and them to their cart.

Nitori Computers uses redux-persist, meaning the cart items will remain within local storage.
